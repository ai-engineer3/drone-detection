To run this YOLOv8-based object counting application, 
first ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
 Begin by creating a virtual environment using python -m venv yolov8-env and activate it (yolov8-env\Scripts\activate on Windows or source yolov8-env/bin/activate on macOS/Linux).
 Next, install the required libraries via pip: run pip install opencv-python PyQt5 ultralytics torch torchvision torchaudio
 (the last three are needed for YOLOv8; Ultralytics will automatically handle compatible PyTorch versions).
 Download a custom or pretrained YOLOv8 model (e.g., yolov8n.pt or your yolov8-drone.pt) and place it in the project directory.
 For live camera access, ensure a webcam is connected and accessible (index 0). Finally, save the provided Python script as main.py 
and execute it with python main.py. The GUI will launch, allowing image/video upload or real-time detection upon clicking the respective buttons
